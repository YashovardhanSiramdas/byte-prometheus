# Prometheus
We are team Prometheus. The name is inspired from an open source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. We are participating in an intra college hackathon named `Byte` at IIITDM Kancheepuram.

## Idea
A voice recording application which records user's voice and saves it in a DB. The recorded voice can also be shared via Facebook, Twitter etc.
